## Mission Statement

> We build custom tools that fit your business—so you can stop wrestling with technology and focus on the work that matters.

**Alternate versions:**

> We help small businesses reclaim their time by building tools that work the way they do—not the other way around.

> We turn repetitive work into reliable systems, giving business owners their time and attention back.

## Core Values

### 1. Clarity Over Complexity
We translate technical possibilities into plain language. Our job is to make technology feel simple, not to impress anyone with jargon.

### 2. Fit Over Features
We don't sell tools—we solve problems. Every solution is shaped around how our clients actually work, not how software vendors think they should.

### 3. Partnership Over Projects
We build relationships, not just deliverables. Our best work happens when we understand a business deeply and grow alongside it.

### 4. Craftsmanship Over Speed
We take the time to build things right. A well-built system pays dividends for years; a rushed one creates headaches for just as long.

### 5. Honesty Over Sales
We'll tell you if something isn't worth building. Trust is more valuable than any single project.

## Color Palette

### Color Principles
- Use color sparingly—let whitespace do the work
- Accent color should draw attention to one thing per view
- Avoid gradients; prefer flat, solid colors
- High contrast for readability

---

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Typography

**Type Principles:**
- Headlines should be bold and direct—say more with fewer words
- Body text should be comfortable to read in long form
- Generous line-height (1.5–1.7 for body text)

### Layout & Spacing

**Whitespace:**
- Whitespace is a feature, not wasted space
- Let elements breathe—crowded layouts feel desperate
- Section padding: 80–120px vertical on desktop
- Content max-width: 1200px (often narrower for text-heavy sections)

**Grid:**
- 12-column grid for flexibility
- Generous gutters (24–32px)
- Asymmetry is okay—not everything needs to be centered

### Imagery & Graphics

**Photography Style:**
- Authentic, not stocky
- Real workplaces, real people (when possible)
- Avoid generic "person pointing at screen" imagery
- When using stock, choose understated, documentary-style images

**Illustrations & Icons:**
- Simple, geometric line icons
- Consistent stroke weight
- Avoid overly playful or cartoonish styles
- Icons should clarify, not decorate

**Graphics:**
- Abstract shapes used sparingly for visual interest
- Prefer subtle background textures over busy patterns
- Data visualizations should be clean and readable

### UI Elements

**Buttons:**
- Primary: Solid fill with accent color, bold text
- Secondary: Outline or ghost style
- Generous padding, rounded corners (4–8px radius)
- Clear hover/focus states

**Cards:**
- Subtle shadow or border—not both
- Consistent padding (24–32px)
- Clear hierarchy within the card

**Forms:**
- Large, comfortable input fields
- Clear labels above inputs
- Helpful microcopy where needed
- Obvious error and success states

## Voice Guidelines

### Voice Attributes

**1. Clear**
We say what we mean without jargon or filler. If a client needs a dictionary to understand us, we've failed.

**2. Calm**
We're confident without being loud. Our clients are often stressed—our voice should feel like relief.

**3. Helpful**
We lead with usefulness. Every piece of content should leave someone better informed or more capable.

**4. Human**
We sound like people, not a corporation. Contractions are fine. Personality is welcome. Stiffness is not.

**5. Honest**
We don't overpromise or hide behind vague language. If we don't know something, we say so.

### Tone Shifts by Context

|---------|-----------------|
| Website homepage | Confident, benefit-focused, concise |

| Email (prospecting) | Warm, respectful of their time, low-pressure |
| Email (client) | Friendly, direct, collaborative |

### Writing Principles

**Lead with outcomes, not features**
- Yes: "Answer tenant questions 24/7 without lifting a finger"
- No: "AI-powered RAG system with natural language processing"

**Be specific over generic**
- Yes: "One property manager saved 12 hours a week on tenant inquiries"
- No: "We help businesses save time"

**Respect their intelligence**
- Don't oversimplify to the point of condescension
- Assume they're smart—just busy and not technical

**Keep it scannable**
- Short paragraphs
- Clear headings
- Bullet points for lists
- Bold key phrases
